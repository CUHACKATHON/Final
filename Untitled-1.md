- The HOC chat bot is built using a mix of rule-based logic and basic machine learning models for natural language understanding.
- It utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to detect intent and sentiment in user inputs.
- Predefined intents (e.g., booking, stress, emergency, FAQs) are mapped to responses using a decision tree.
- For advanced queries, it leverages a lightweight transformer model and can escalate to a human counselor if needed.
- Training data consists of anonymized conversational data, common student queries, and validated mental health advice, curated with the help of mental health professionals.
- The bot responds instantly to common issues and provides empathetic, informative replies.

Future upgrades may involve integrating GPT-based models (like OpenAI GPT or similar) for more adaptive, personalized support while ensuring data privacy.
